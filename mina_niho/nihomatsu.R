##purposes of this vehicle survey were 
#(1) to ascertain the tendency and cause of time change of air dose rates by comparing past vehicle survey 
#data and survey meter data at the height of 1 m above ground as well as "walk survey" data, and 
# (2) to contribute to the establishment of radioactive substances distribution prediction model.

# Loading June 2011 Fukushima Data and selecting Nihomatsu's.

#MEXT evaluated the decrease in the air dose rates caused by the decay of cesium during the survey period and it was around 1%, 
# which was smaller than the errors of measuring instruments http://emdb.jaea.go.jp/emdb/en/portals/b131/
